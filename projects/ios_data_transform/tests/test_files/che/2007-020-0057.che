    CTD Data Processing Notes:
    --------------------------

    For full details see report Physical and chemical data from the Canada Basin July 26 to
    August 31, 2007 cited below.

    Standard seabird processing steps and Matlab based routines were used.

    CTD Pressure: Lab calibration (29th Oct 2002) adjusted by applying -0.48dbar offset to the bias
    based on in-air surface readings of the CTD.

    CTD Temperature: Pre-cruise lab calibration was used after comparisons with dual sensor and
    post-cruise calibration information.

    CTD Conductivity: Pre-cruise lab calibration adjusted after comparisons with dual sensor,
    post-cruise calibrations and water sample data.  Primary conductivity adjusted by bias of
    +0.0018 mS/cm . Secondary conductivity adjusted by bias of +0.0016 mS/cm.

    CTD Oxygen: Oxygen data are from a SeaBird SBE43 sensor with pumped flow in-line after the
    primary temperature and conductivity sensors. A lag of -8 seconds was applied to oxygen voltage
    in the Seabird processing step Align. Downcast CTD oxygen voltage and upcast temperature and
    salinity were used to calibrate CTD to water sample oxygen (upcast). The  107 casts required
    6 calibration groups. Fitting method followed Seabirds Application Note 64-2 (�SBE 43 Dissolved
    Oxygen Sensor Calibration and Data Corrections using Winkler Titrations�). A remaining pressure
    dependent shape in the residual between water sample and CTD oxygen was removed by subtracting
    a mean curve. Parts of the mean curve were found by fitting sections of data from discreet
    pressure ranges. The parts were then stitched together via spline interpolation to create a
    full profile mean curve.

    CTD Fluorometer: Fluorometer data are from a Seapoint sensor with pumped flow in-line after the
    secondary temperature and conductivity sensors. Calibration with bottle data performed using
    bottle chlorophyll values between 0.025 and 0.60 mg/m3. The number of observations used were 116
    out of 141 with a standard deviation of 0.03 in the residuals. Coefficients used: Slope: 0.7909,
    Bias: -0.0045. Alignment of -4 seconds was used. Frequent single dropouts in fluorescence to 0
    have been fixed by setting to neighbor value.

    ISUS: Data are uncalibrated. The voltage is proportional to nitrate.

    Transmissometer data are unprocessed, using calibration from 28 Aug 2006.

    PAR data are unprocessed, using corrected calibration from 13 Mar 2007.

    Altimeter data are unprocessed, using calibration from Mar 2005.

    Data Notes:
    - Spikes in temperature, conductivity and oxygen have been linearly interpolated over and where
      needed secondary values (when available) have replaced the primary values.

    Chemistry Sampling and Analysis Methods:
    ---------------------------------------

    For full details see report "Physical and chemical Data from the Canada Basin, July 26 to
    August 31, 2007." cited below.

    Salinity samples were collected in 200 mL type II glass bottles with disposable plastic
    inserts and screw caps.  On board, samples were analyzed in a temperature-controlled lab
    on a Guildline AutoSalinometer Model 8400B (SN: 69086), which was standardized with IAPSO
    standard seawater. Onshore, 2 casts were analyzed November 2007 on the Guildline
    AutoSalinometer Model 8400B (SN: 68572), which was standardized with IAPSO standard seawater.

    Dissolved Oxygen:
      Oxygen samples were collected in glass flasks and analyzed on board on an automated
      Micro-Winkler titration system following the procedures of Carpenter (1965). The titration
      was performed with a Metrohn Dosimat 665 and the end point was detected using a Brinkmann
      probe Colorimeter PC910 (SN: 910-358). Software written at the Institute of Ocean Sciences,
      NewAutoOxy.exe, was used to calculate dissolved oxygen (ml/L).

      Oxygen data received correction post-cruise in May 2008 and February 2009 of 0.0 to 0.3 mL/L
      after recalibrating the volume of potassium iodide standard, identifing one unexplained
      drift in the uniform bottom water, and recalibrating flask volumes.

    Nutrient samples (nitrate plus nitrite, silicate and orthophosphate) were collected in
    polystyrene test tubes. If analysis could be performed on board within 24 hours the samples
    were stored at 4 degree C, if not they were frozen at -20 degree C. Note Surfactants for all
    three nutrients were misplaced during shipping. Palmolive dish detergent was an effective
    surfactant for nitrate and silicate but not for phosphate. Beginning August 12th with Cast 43,
    all phosphate samples were frozen in glass for analysis at the Institute of Ocean Sciences(IOS).
    Frozen samples were analyzed at IOS February and March 2008. Samples were not filtered. Samples
    were analyzed using a Technicon auto-analyzer following methods described in Barwell-Clarke and
    Whitney (1996).

    Ammonium samples were collected in 50 mL glass tubes, and analysed onboard following the Holmes
    et al. (1999) fluorometric protocol. Samples were kept in the dark for 5 to 8 hours at room
    temperature. Samples were then measured using a Turner Designs TD-700 fluorometer.

    Oxygen Isotopes Samples were collected into 30 ml glass vials. Once at room  temperature, the
    caps were retightened and wrapped with parafilm for storage. The bulk of the samples (623)
    were analyzed January to March 2008 at Oregon State University's COAS Stable Isotope Lab using
    a Thermo Finnigan Delta Plus XL isotope ratio mass spectrometer with precision between
    +/- <0.05%.Samples from 9 stations (92) were analyzed at Hokkaido University using a mass
    spectrometer. Samples were analyzed December 2007.

    Barium samples were collected in ~20 ml plastic vials. Once at room temperature the caps were
    retightened for storage. Barium concentrations were determined at Oregon State University,
    using isotope-dilution and a VG Thermo Excel Inductively coupled quadrupole mass spectrometer
    as previously described with minor modifications (Falkner et al., 1994).

    Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) and Alkalinity:
      DIC and Alkalinity were collected into 250 or 500 mL glass bottles. Samples were kept at
      4 degree C until analysis and preserved with HgCl2.

      Alkalinity ("Alkalinity:Total") and DIC ("Carbon:Dissolved:Inorganic") were measured from the
      same sample bottle at select stations. In addition, more frequent samples of Alkalinity were
      collected at most stations and have been labelled "Alkalinity:Total:Potentiometric" to
      distinguish this set of separate samples, even though both sets of Alkalinity samples were
      measured using potentiometric titration.

      DIC was analyzed at the Institute of Ocean Sciences using a SOMMA (Single-Operator
      Multi-Metabolic Analyzer) - Coulometer system to determine DIC.

      Alkalinity samples were analyzed at the Institute of Ocean Sciences using an automated
      potentiometric titration system to determine the total alkalinity.

    Total Chlorophyll-a (>0.7um) samples were collected into 2 L brown Nalgene sample bottles,
    immediately placed in dark bags and stored in a fridge. Samples were filtered onto 25mm GF/F
    filters using low vacuum filtration. The filters were put in scintillation vials and either
    extracted immediately or frozen at -20 degree C until analysis. All samples were analyzed on
    board. For analysis, 10 ml of 90% acetone was added to the scintillation vial which was then
    put into a -20 degree C freezer for 24 hours. The samples were allowed to adjust to room
    temperature for an hour before being read with the fluorometer. Chlorophyll-a and phaeo-pigment
    levels were measured with a Turner Designs 10 AU-005 Field Fluorometer SN:5152FRXX calibrated
    with a commercially pure chl-a standard (Sigma). The sample was acidified with 2 drops of 1N
    hydrochloric acid to obtain the phaeo-pigment reading. Chlorophyll estimates and phaeopigment
    estimates are calculated following the procedure in JGOFS manual (1994) cited below.

    Phytoplankton and bacterioplankton were collected in 2 ml capacity cryogenic vial and fixed with
    0.2 ml of 10% paraformaldehyde by vortex mixing. Samples were maintained for at least 15 min at
    laboratory temperature to allow fixation, and then stored at -80 degree C until analysis at the
    Bedford Institute of Oceanography. Cell concentrations of picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton,
    and bacterioplankton (i.e. non-autofluorescent picoplankton) in thawed samples were analyzed by
    flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACSort) following protocols in routine use (Li and Dickie,
    2001).

    Iodine 129 samples were collected into 1 L PVC bottles Samples and returned to the Laboratory of
    the Atlantic Environmental Radioactivity Unit (AERU) at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography
    (BIO). In the laboratory, a NaI carrier was added to a 200 mL aliquot of the seawater sample, it
    was slightly acidified, purified using multiple hexane extractions and iodine was precipitated
    as NaI. The NaI precipitate was shipped to the IsoTrace Laboratory at the University of Toronto
    where 129I analyses were performed by accelerator mass spectrometry (Smith et al. 1998; 1999;
    2005).

    Cesium 137 samples were collected into four 10 L plastic carboys from approximately 40 L of
    seawater. The water samples were passed through a potassium ferrocyanide (KCFC) packed resin
    column in the laboratory (AERU) which quantitatively extracts 137Cs from seawater (Smith et al.
    1990; Smith & Ellis 1995). The KCFC resin was deployed in a standard geometry and measured using
    a hyperpure Ge detector having an efficiency of 25%.

    Particulate organic carbon (POC) samples were collected into 2 L Nalgene bottles. Onboard ship,
    4 L samples were filtered onto 47 mm GF75 filters that had been pre-combusted at 500 degree C
    for 4 hours. The filtration was performed within 4 hours of sampling unless otherwise noted.
    Samples were analyzed at the University of British Columbia. The filters were first dried for
    24 hours at 50 degree C, then fumed with HCl for 48 hours, dried again at 50 degree C for
    24 hours, and then wrapped in aluminum foil and pressed into pellets. The pellets were run
    through the CN analyzer where the POC was determined.

    Total suspended solids samples were collected into 2 L Nalgene bottles. Onboard ship, 4 to
    6 L were filtered onto 47 mm 0.4 �m polycarbonate nucleopore filters, that had been rinsed
    acid cleaned, rinsed with DMQ water, dried at 50 �C and pre-weighed to 0.001 mg. The filters
    were rinsed with 3% Ammonium carbonate solution after filtration was complete. The filters
    were then placed in a labeled 50 mm plastic petrie dish and frozen at -20 �C. The filtration
    was performed within 4 hours of sampling unless otherwise noted. Samples were analyzed at the
    University of British Columbia. Once in the lab, the TSS samples were dried at 50 �C for 24
    hours and then weighed. The TSS concentration was equal to the final weight minus the initial
    weight divided by the volume of water filtered.
