  Date 2021/09/02 06:49:00: OXY-2: Endpoint was late due to a runaway titration.  Sample
                            over-titrated.
  Date 2021/09/05 01:02:00: SAL:  Only one measurement recorded due to running out of sample.  Value
                            calculated using the recorded conductivity on the analysis log sheet.
                            Impossible value for surface.
  Sampling Methods are expressed with the following codes
  -------------------------------------------------------
      ROS - Rosette sample
      USW - Uncontaminated sea water (loop)
      -------------------------------------------------------

  Sampling System
  ---------------
   The seawater is drawn from a 20-cm x 56-cm standpipe, flush with the hull
   and located 4.5 metres below the water line, and pumped approximately 50
   metres through a 5-cm stainless steel insulated pipe up to the main lab.
   Between the intake and the pump is a 24 x 24-cm stainless steel strainer
   (1/2-cm grid). The pump is a Moyno model 2L6 stainless steel progressive
   cavity pump with flow and pressure control.

  Analysis methods:
  -----------------
  Chlorophyll samples were filtered onto 25mm GF/F filters and stored in glass
  scintillation vials at -80C prior to analysis. Samples were extracted in
  90% acetone at -20C for 24 hours in the lab and analyzed on a Turner 10AU fluorometer
  calibrated with commercially pure chlorophyll a standard (Sigma).
  Fluorescence readings taken before and after acidification were used to
  calculate chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations (Holm-Hansen et al 1965).
  Chlorophyll samples were analyzed at IOS in Room 2423 1 to 5 weeks after the cruise.
  Variability is assessed as the CV% (std dev / mean*100).
  Flags and comments apply to chlorophyll values only.
  Chlorophyll values ranged from  0.05-20.68 ug/l in 103 samples.
  Average %CV for this cruise was 5.86% (after one duplicate was rejected, original 8.25%)
  with 5 out of 23 duplicate pairs having a CV>10% and 0 duplicate pairs having a CV>30%.
  Our average dataset %CV is 3.83% for 2013 - 2020 so the overall quality of this dataset
  is acceptable.
  For details see worksheet “CV%” in file QF2021-008_CHL*.xlsx.

  Oxygen samples were analyzed at sea using an automated Winkler titration System
  (Metrohm Dosimat model 876 and a UV light source and detector with a 365nm filter
  controlled by LV02_876 software designed and constructed by Scripps Institution
  of Oceanography) with modifications based on Carpenter (1965) and adhering to
  WOCE protocols (Culberson 1991).
  For details including a duplicate analysis, see document QF2021-008OXY*.xlsx.

  Salinity samples were collected in 200 mL type ll glass bottles with disposable
  nylon inserts and screw caps supplied by Ocean Scientific International Limited.
  They were analyzed in a temperature-controlled lab on a Guildline 8400B Salinometer
  standardized with IAPSO standard seawater 68 - 75 days after collection.
  For details including a duplicate analysis, see document QF2021-008SAL*.xlsx.

  Nutrient samples were collected in plastic tubes and quick frozen in aluminum
  blocks stored in a -20C freezer. For samples 400m and deeper a second set of
  samples are collected and stored cool for silicate analysis. All samples were
  returned to the Insitute of Ocean Sciences and they were analyzed using an
  Astoria-Pacific Analyzer following methods described in
  IOS Nutrient Methods (1996) Barwell-Clarke and Whitney.
  For details including a duplicate analysis, see document QF2021-008nuts*.xlsx.

  DMS samples were collected in 250mL ground glass stoppered bottles and stored in a
  fridge, in the dark and removed one at a time before analysis. A sample was loaded
  onto the stripper and purged with UHP Nitrogen for 10 minutes at ~100mL/min.
  The DMS was extracted from the water and absorbed into a Tenax TA trap kept at -80C.
  The trap was subsequently desorbed at 100 deg C (with a dewar containing boiling water)
  onto a Chromosil 330 column which eluted onto a Flame Photometric Detector (FPD).
  All samples were run as soon as possible after being collected.
  The minimum detectable level for DMS is 0.10 nmol/L, so “0” values should be
  interpreted as <0.1nmol/L.
  DMS data are limited to 2 significant figures.
  Unless otherwise indicated the % relative difference between duplicates is <20%.
  For more detail see file "2021-008 DMS report*.doc" and for data and duplicate analysis
  see "QF2021-008_DMS_summary*.xls."

  DMSP-D: Approximately 50-100mL of seawater is drained from the niskin into a magnetic
  filtration funnel containing a 0.7um GF/F filter.  The first 3.5mL is collected
  in a polypropylene tube containing 50uL of a 50% sulphuric acid solution.
  A new funnel and filter are used for each sample.
  DMSP-T: 3.5mL of seawater was collected directly from the Niskin into a polypropylene
  tube (15mL) containing 50uL of a 50% sulphuric acid solution.
  DMSP-D and DMSP-T:
  Samples are stored in the dark at 4 degrees C for a minimum of 24 hours. They are
  hydrolized and analyzed at the Institute of Ocean Sciences when time permits.
  The minimum detectable level is 0.1 nM, so “0” values should be interpreted as <0.1 nM.
  DMSP data are limited to 2 significant figures.
  Unless otherwise indicated the % relative difference between duplicates is <20%.
  For details on analysis and raw data, see document "QF2021-008_dmsp_summary*.xlsx.

  CTD Data Processing Notes:
  --------------------------
  Conductivity, Transmissivity, Fluorescence:URU:Seapoint and PAR data are
  nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature
  and salinity.

  There were 2 WetLabs CStar transmissometers in use during this cruise:
      Channel Transmissometer refers to sensor #1185DR (650nm - red)
      Channel Transmissometer:Green refers to sensor #1883DG (530nm - green)
  For comparison with other Institute of Ocean Sciences cruises, note that the
  transmissometer wavelength is 650nm unless otherwise stated.

  NOTE: While the CTD fluorescence data are expressed in concentration units, they
  do not always compare well to extracted chlorophyll samples, particularly for
  casts far from shore. It is recommended that users check extracted chlorophyll
  values where available.

  Both salinity channels were found to be reading much lower relative to bottle
  samples than in 3 previous cruises using the same equipment, and a little lower
  than during the cruise that followed. Channel Salinity:T1:C1 was found to be lower
  than bottles by an average of 0.0055psu in deep water. Since delayed analysis and
  small errors due to incomplete flushing both would have led to bottle values being
  too high, no recalibration was applied to the CTD salinity. While confidence in the
  bottle comparison is lower than usual, it is likely that channel Salinity:T1:C1
  is within ±0.003psu.

  The dissolved oxygen sensor was mounted on the primary pump and all primary channels
  produced bad data for cast #37. The system returned to reasonable values by the end
  of the cast, but there was some evidence of drift in primary temperature and salinity
  thereafter. The dissolved oxgyen data looked ok in the comparison with bottles
  except for cast #37. Dissolved oxygen was removed from file 2021-008-0037.che.
