          Quality flags have the following significance:
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          0 = Acceptable measurement with no header comment
          1 = Sample for this measurement was collected but not analyzed. Sample lost.
          2 = Acceptable measurement with header comment
          3 = Questionable measurement (Probably Good)
          4 = Poor measurement (Probably Bad)
          5 = Measurement not reported (Bad)
          6 = Mean of replicate measurements
          7 = Manual chromatographic peak measurement
          8 = Irregular digital chromatographic peak integration
          9 = Sample was planned for this measurement from this bottle but was not collected

    -------------------------------------------------------
        ROS - Rosette sample
        USW - Uncontaminated sea water (loop)
    -------------------------------------------------------

    Sampling System
    ---------------
     The seawater is drawn from a 20-cm x 56-cm standpipe, flush with the hull
     and located 4.5 metres below the water line, and pumped approximately 50
     metres through a 5-cm stainless steel insulated pipe up to the main lab.
     Between the intake and the pump is a 24 x 24-cm stainless steel strainer
     (1/2-cm grid). The pump is a Moyno model 2L6 stainless steel progressive
     cavity pump with flow and pressure control.

    Analysis methods:
    -----------------
        Chlorophyll samples were filtered onto 25mm GF/F filters and stored in glass
        scintillation vials at -80C prior to analysis. Samples were extracted in
        90% acetone at -20C for 24 hours in the lab and analyzed on a Turner 10AU fluorometer
        calibrated with commercially pure chlorophyll a standard (Sigma).
        Fluorescence readings taken before and after acidification were used to
        calculate chlorophyll and phaeopigment concentrations (Holm-Hansen et al 1965).
        Chlorophyll samples were analyzed at IOS in Room 2423 ~2 weeks after the cruise.
        The average of two samples is reported. Variability is assessed as the
        CV% (std dev / mean*100).
        Flags and comments apply to chlorophyll values only.
        Precision Statement: Chlorophyll values ranged from 0.01-1.56ug/l in 102 samples.
          Average %CV for this cruise was 4.17% with 3 out of 53 duplicate pairs having a CV>10%
          and 0 out of 53 duplicate pairs having a CV>30%. Our average dataset %CV is 3.80%
          for 2013 - 2018 so the overall quality of this dataset is very good.
        For details see worksheet “CV%” in file QF2019-001CHL*.xls.

        Oxygen samples were analyzed at sea using an automated Winkler titration System
        (Metrohm Dosimat model 876 and a UV light source and detector with a 365nm filter
        controlled by LV02_876 software designed and constructed by Scripps Institution
        of Oceanography) with modifications based on Carpenter (1965) and adhering to
        WOCE protocols (Culberson 1991).
        For details including a duplicate analysis, see document QF2019-001OXY*.xls.

        Salinity samples were collected in 200 mL type ll glass bottles with disposable
        nylon inserts and screw caps supplied by Ocean Scientific International Limited.
        They were analyzed in a temperature-controlled lab using two different Guildline
        8400B Salinometers standardized with IAPSO standard seawater. The first 51 samples
        were analyzed using salinometers s/n 68572 within 19-34 days of collection. The
        remainder of the samples were analyzed using salinometer s/n #69086 within 29-47
        days of collection.
        For details including a duplicate analysis, see document QF2019-001SAL*.xls.
        51 Salinity:Bottle values required recalculation due to non-linearity in the
        Autosal s/n 68572. See the notes in the above document for more details.

        Nutrient samples were collected in plastic tubes and quick frozen in aluminum
        blocks stored in -20 freezer. One set of samples was collected and frozen immediately.
        Another set of samples from 400m and deeper (to be used for silicate analysis) was
        collected and stored at 4C in the dark. All samples were returned to IOS for
        analysis. They were analyzed using an Astoria analyzer following methods described
        in IOS Nutrient Methods (1996) Barwell-Clarke and Whitney.
        Some samples were collected using polypropylene bottles instead of nutrient tubes
        due to a limit of supply for additional stations. Two stations were compared with
        both nutrient tubes and polypropylene bottles.
        For details, including a duplicate analysis and a comparison of 2 stations that had
        samples from both polypropylene bottles and nutrient tubes, see document
        QF2019-001nuts*.xls.

        DMS samples were collected in 250mL ground glass stoppered bottles and stored in a
        fridge, in the dark and removed one at a time before analysis. A sample was loaded
        onto the stripper and purged with UHP Nitrogen for 10 minutes at ~100mL/min.
        The DMS was extracted from the water and absorbed on to a Tenax TA trap kept at -80C.
        The trap was subsequently desorbed at 100 deg C (with a dewar containing boiling water)
        onto a Chromasorb 330 column which eluted onto a Flame Photometric Detector (FPD).
        All samples were run as soon as possible after being collected.
        For more detail see file "2019-001 DMS report.doc" and for data and duplicate analysis
        see "DMS summary (2019-001).xls."
        The minimum detectable level for DMS is 0.10 nmol/L, so “0” values should be
        interpreted as <0.1nmol/L.

        DMSP-D: Approximately 50-75mL of seawater was allowed to flow directly from the niskin
        into a filtration funnel containing a 0.7um GF/F filter.  The first 3.5mL was collected
        in a polypropylene tube (15mL) containing 50uL of a 50% sulphuric acid solution.
        DMPS-T: 3.5mL of seawater was collected directly from the niskin into a polypropylene
        tube (15mL) containing 50uL of a 50% sulphuric acid solution.
        DMSP-D and DMSP-T:
        Samples are stored in the dark at 4 degrees C for a minimum of 24 hours. They are
        hydrolized and analyzed later at the Institute of Ocean Sciences.
        The minimum detectable level is 0.1 nM, so “0” values should be interpreted as <0.1 nM.
        For details on analysis and raw data, see document "2019-001 dmsp QF summary.xls.

        CTD Data Processing Notes:
        --------------------------
        Conductivity, Transmissivity, Fluorescence and PAR data are nominal and unedited
        except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.

        NOTE: While the CTD fluorescence data are expressed in concentration units, they
        do not always compare well to extracted chlorophyll samples, particularly for
        casts far from shore. It is recommended that users check extracted chlorophyll
        values where available.

        Dissolved oxygen was calibrated using the method described in SeaBird
        Application Note #64-2, June 2012 revision, except that a small
        offset in the fit was allowed.

        For details on the processing see the report: 2019-001_Processing_Report.doc.
