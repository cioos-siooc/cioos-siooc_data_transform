# IOS Data Conversion

This python package was created to aid in the conversion of data from an IOS (Institute of Ocean Sciences) specific format to netCDF files.
The netCDF files are compatible with the CF conventions and ERDDAP requirements.

## Description of classes and important methods

- ObsFile (extensions: CtdFile, BotFile, etc.): Includes variables and methods to read data in the IOS format. Information is processed and stored in state variables used by OceanNcFile (or similar).
- OceanNcFile (extensions: CtdNcFile etc.): Includes methods required to write a netCDF file in the standard format. Data is held in object until write_file function is executed.
- OceanNcVar: Holds variable data and definition. List of these objects are passed to OceanNcFile to write out in a standard format.

## Getting Started / Installing
