        This Python implementation of the Thermodynamic Equation of
        Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based primarily on numpy ufunc wrappers of
        the GSW-C implementation.  We expect it to replace the original
        `python-gsw <https://github.com/TEOS-10/python-gsw/>`__
        pure-python implementation after a brief overlap period.
        The primary reasons for this change are that by building on the
        C implementation we reduce code duplication and we gain an immediate
        update to the 75-term equation.  Additional benefits include a
        major increase in speed, a reduction in memory usage, and the
        inclusion of more functions.  The penalty is that a C (or MSVC C++ for
        Windows) compiler is required to build the package from source.
        
        **Warning: this is for Python >=3.5 only.**
        
        **Warning:** the only *official* TEOS-10 implementations are
        provided as zipfiles at <http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm>.
        
        Documentation is provided at <https://teos-10.github.io/GSW-Python/>.
        
        For the core functionality, we use an auto-generated C extension
        module to wrap the C functions as numpy
        `ufuncs <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html>`__,
        and then use an
        autogenerated Python module to add docstrings and handle masked
        arrays.  165 scalar C functions with only double-precision
        arguments and return values are wrapped as ufuncs, and 158 of
        these are exposed in the ``gsw`` namespace with an additional
        wrapper in Python.
        
        A hand-written wrapper is used for one C function, and others
        are re-implemented directly in Python instead of being wrapped.
        Additional functions present in GSW-Matlab but not in GSW-C may
        be re-implemented in Python, but there is no expectation that
        all such functions will be provided.
        
        The package can be installed from a clone of the repo using
        ``pip install .``.  It is neither necessary nor recommended
        to run the code generators, and no instructions are provided
        for them; their output is
        included in the repo.  You will need a suitable compiler: gcc or
        clang for unix-like systems, or the MSVC compiler set used for Python
        itself on Windows.  For Windows, some of the source code has been
        modified to C++ because the MSVC C compiler does not support the
        C99 complex data type used in original GSW-C.
        
        To test, after installation, run "py.test" from the source directory.
