The daily sampling strategy at BC shore stations was designed long ago by Dr. John P. Tully. We have chosen not to change the strategy in the interests of a homogeneous data set. A sea water sample is collected by immersing a bucket in the seawater and measuring the temperature and salinity of the water in the bucket; sampling occurs at or near the daytime high tide. Sampling at the daytime high tide means, for example, that if an observer starts sampling one day at 6 a.m.(local time) and continues to sample at the daytime hightide then on the 2nd day the sample will be taken at about 06:50, the next day at 07:40 and so on. When the daytime high tide occurs in the late afternoon the sampling time reverts to the next morning and the cycle starts again. Since there is a diurnal signal in sea-surface temperature the sampling creates a 14-day signal as an artifact in the daily data. The monthly data are calculated by averaging the daily data of each month.
